# MNIST Tutorials with PyTorch

Welcome to this series of tutorials on building machine learning models using PyTorch to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This repository contains three tutorials designed to guide you from a beginner level to more advanced concepts and techniques in deep learning with PyTorch.

## Tutorials Overview

### 1. MNIST & PyTorch: Building a Simple Linear Classifier (Beginner)
This tutorial is intended for individuals who are familiar with Python and basic machine learning concepts but are new to PyTorch. It covers the fundamental steps to build a simple linear classifier (logistic regression) and provides a solid foundation for constructing a machine learning pipeline.

**What You Will Learn:**
- Loading and preprocessing data using PyTorch's DataLoader.
- Defining a simple linear model using PyTorch's neural network modules.
- Implementing a training loop to train your model on the MNIST dataset.
- Evaluating model performance on the test dataset.
- Visualizing and interpreting the results of your trained model.
- Understanding the basics of model training, from design to evaluation.

### 2. MNIST & PyTorch: Building a Proper Pipeline (Intermediate)
This tutorial builds upon the concepts covered in the beginner tutorial and is designed for those who have a good grasp of Python and are ready to delve deeper into machine learning with PyTorch. You will learn to set up a more sophisticated machine learning pipeline and implement AlexNet, one of the first modern convolutional neural networks.

**What You Will Learn:**
- Loading and visualizing data more effectively.
- Extending the ML pipeline with cross-validation, early stopping, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Building a baseline linear model, a simple feedforward neural network, and AlexNet.
- Testing models and visualizing the results.
- Appreciating the importance of a well-structured ML pipeline for more complex models.

### 3. MNIST & PyTorch: Deepening Your MNIST Skills (Advanced)
This tutorial is designed for those who have completed the beginner and intermediate tutorials and are ready to tackle more advanced topics in deep learning with PyTorch. You'll extend your ML pipeline with techniques like explicit weight initialization, batch normalization, and regularization, and build a deep CNN to optimize performance.

**What You Will Learn:**
- Loading and visualizing data with a focus on preparing for deep learning models.
- Incorporating explicit weight initialization, batch normalization, and regularization into your ML pipeline.
- Building a baseline linear model, a simple feedforward neural network, and a deep CNN.
- Experimenting with different architectures thanks to a robust ML pipeline.
- Testing models and visualizing results to fine-tune and improve performance.

## Future ideas
There are a number of ideas I'm either working on or would like to implement in the future. These are:

- Implementing uncertainty quantification in the advanced tutorial.
- Implementing Tensorboard logging in the intermediate/advanced tutorial.
- Implement model interpretability in the advanced tutorial.
- Make python scripts that have similar functionality to the tutorials.
