    "This advanced MNIST tutorial builds on the beginner and intermediate MNIST tutorials I made. They make the most sense when looked through from beginner to advanced but each notebook should be interpretable on its own. These tutorials are more of a walk-through, and focus more on the code and proper ML etiquite than explanations for everything I do. To make up for that, I leave links for pieces of code or concepts that I use. These links will direct you to places that will surely give you a lot better explanations than if I were to try! Hopefully, the notebook and the links together create a coherent walk-through to tackle the MNIST dataset."
